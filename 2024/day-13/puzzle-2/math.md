# Solving the System of Equations for a and b

We are solving the following system of linear equations:

x = ax * a + ay * b  
y = bx * a + by * b

where x, y, ax, ay, bx, by are constants, and a and b are the unknowns.

## Step 1: Write in Matrix Form
The equations can be written in matrix form as:  
[ ax  ay ] [ a ] = [ x ]  
[ bx  by ] [ b ]   [ y ]

This gives two linear equations:
1. ax * a + ay * b = x
2. bx * a + by * b = y

---

## Step 2: Calculate the Determinant
The determinant (Delta) of the coefficient matrix is:  
Delta = (ax * by) - (ay * bx)

---

## Step 3: Solve for a and b
### Case 1: If Delta is not zero (Unique Solution)
The system has a unique solution. Solve using Cramer's Rule:  
a = [(by * x) - (ay * y)] / Delta  
b = [(ax * y) - (bx * x)] / Delta

### Case 2: If Delta is zero (No or Infinite Solutions)
- **No Solution**: If x and y do not satisfy the same linear relationship as the rows of the coefficient matrix.  
  That is, if x / ax is not equal to y / bx or x / ay is not equal to y / by.
- **Infinite Solutions**: If x and y satisfy the same linear relationship as the rows of the coefficient matrix.  
  That is, if x / ax = y / bx and x / ay = y / by.

---

## Step 4: Final Expressions for a and b
When Delta is not zero:  
a = [(by * x) - (ay * y)] / [(ax * by) - (ay * bx)]  
b = [(ax * y) - (bx * x)] / [(ax * by) - (ay * bx)]

When Delta is zero, further analysis is needed to determine whether solutions exist.

---

## Summary
1. Compute the determinant: Delta = (ax * by) - (ay * bx).
2. If Delta is not zero, compute a and b using the formulas above.
3. If Delta is zero, check the consistency of the equations to determine if there are infinite solutions or no solutions.
